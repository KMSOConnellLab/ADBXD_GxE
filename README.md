# ADBXD_GxE
AD-BXD mouse phenotyping data
These are datasets from JAX Alzheimer's disease/Aging study

Study summary:
This study uses a genetically diverse mouse model of aging and Alzheimer's disease, the AD-BXDs. 
The AD-BXDs are a panel of 50+ lines of mice that have the 5XFAD (Alzheimer's-causing) transgene or are nontransgenic (Ntg).
5XFAD mice: https://www.jax.org/strain/008730
This study had ~7,000 mice.
These mice were fed either a normal control diet ("6% Extruded") or a high-fat/high-sugar diet ("HFD" or "45% HFD").
In life, mice underwent several tests to measure behavior (cognitive function), metabolic function (indirect calorimetry "IDC", glucose tolerance testing "GTT", body weights), among others
Mice were euthanized at 3, 6, or 14mos of age, with a smaller subset of 22mo terminal timepoints.
Upon euthanasia, brain tissue was collected from each mouse.
Single-nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) was performed on the hypothalamus (HT, n=80), prefrontal cortex (PFC, n=160), and hippocampus (HPC, n=160) of a subset of mice.

We have provided individual-level data and strain-averaged data.

These are data associated with the following preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.07.637137
